#  Shivam Shukla's Data Science Journey: Encryptix Internship

Hi everyone!  I'm Shivam Shukla, a recent MSc graduate in Data Science and Artificial Intelligence. I'm thrilled to share my journey with Encryptix's amazing 4-month virtual internship program.

This program offered a fantastic opportunity to delve into real-world data science challenges and explore a diverse range of projects. Here, you'll find three projects I tackled, each showcasing my application of machine learning models and algorithms.

Project Showcase:

## Project 1: Movie Genre Classification 

This project dives into the fundamentals of machine learning projects, focusing on movie genre classification. It explores essential concepts like text cleaning, feature engineering, and model building using Naive Bayes.

**Let's embark on the journey!**

**1. Imports:**

We'll start by importing the necessary libraries like pandas, NLTK, and scikit-learn.

**2. Dataset Exploration:**

We'll load the dataset and get acquainted with its structure using commands like `df.head()` and `df.info()`.

**3. Visualization & Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**

We'll visualize the data distribution and relationships between features to gain insights.

**4. Data Preprocessing & Text Cleaning:**

We'll prepare the text data for analysis by:
* Removing punctuation and stopwords
* Lowercasing the text
* Applying techniques like Lancaster Stemming to reduce words to their root forms

**5. Text Vectorization with TF-IDF:**

We'll convert the cleaned text into numerical features using TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency). This technique helps identify the most relevant words for each genre.

**6. Splitting Data & Building the Model:**

We'll split the data into training and testing sets. The training set will be used to train a Naive Bayes model to classify movie genres based on the text descriptions.

**7. Prediction & Results:**

We'll use the trained model to predict genres for unseen data and evaluate its performance.

**Necessary Definitions**

* **TF-IDF:** It measures the importance of a word in a document relative to the entire collection.
* **Lancaster Stemmer:** This tool reduces words to their base form, improving text analysis.
* **stopwords.words('english'):** This retrieves common words like "the" and "and" that are often removed during preprocessing as they carry minimal meaning.

**This project provides a solid foundation for understanding the machine learning workflow for text classification tasks. Stay tuned for future projects!**
